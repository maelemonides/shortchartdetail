# shortchartdetail
Get the short chart detail from nba.com
For some reasons it doesn't work all the time
probably because nba.com doesn't allow many requests to be made
can also use the nba api to extract the data
try and use a VPN if not from the us
mostly to just get raw data to use for any dataviz project
